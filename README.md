# Java_Mini_Project
Here we have developed a fee report management system for an educational institution that allows the admin to manage the accounts and accountants to manage the student information and fee records. The system should provide a secure login for both admin and accountant, and the admin should be able to add, view and manage accountants. Accountants should be able to add, view, and edit student records, as well as maintain fee records. The system should also generate reports on the fee status of individual students and overall fee collection of the institution. The system should be user-friendly, efficient, and provide real-time updates to all users.
